    "## Performance and Pricing Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When using Amazon Polly, keep the following in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Character Limits**:\n",
    "   - The synchronous `synthesize_speech` API has a limit of 3,000 characters (including SSML tags)\n",
    "   - For longer text, use the asynchronous `start_speech_synthesis_task` API\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Engine Choice**:\n",
    "   - **Standard**: Lower cost, faster processing\n",
    "   - **Neural**: Higher quality speech, slightly higher cost\n",
    "   - **Long-Form**: Best for long content, higher cost\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Format Considerations**:\n",
    "   - MP3: Compressed format, good quality/size balance\n",
    "   - OGG: Alternative compressed format\n",
    "   - PCM: Uncompressed, highest quality but larger files\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Pricing**: Amazon Polly charges per character processed, with different rates based on the engine:\n",
    "   - Standard: Lower cost per million characters\n",
    "   - Neural: Higher cost per million characters\n",
    "   - First million characters per month may be free under the AWS Free Tier\n",
    "   - For current pricing, check the [Amazon Polly pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/pricing/)"
