# Quick Start - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)

Because Amazon Polly is a set of APIs hosted in AWS the `aws cli` tooling can be used to interact with Polly directly from the command line

### Setup

In this setup we assume the user already have an AWS Account, and has the ability to create IAM Policies or has a role with the  `AmazonPollyFullAccess` policy that is supplied by AWS.

- Install the AWS CLI using the [AWS CLI User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)
    -  You will find steps for Windows, macOS, and Linux along with any necessary pre-requisite dependencies that need to be installed
- Configure the credentials for AWS CLI using the [configuration guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
- You can review ALL Polly commands in the [reference guide for Polly](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/polly/index.html#cli-aws-polly).

### Your First Polly Command 

One of the fastest ways to understand Polly is to look at the available voices that can be used in a particular region. This is helpful in avoiding unexpected errors when converting text to speech. This step assumes you have completed the CLI Setup mentioned above

```sh
aws polly describe-voices
```
This command will list all voices and in what way they can be used, providing back meta-data like `SupportEngines`, `LanguageCode`, and `Id`. An example output:

```json
{
    "Voices": [
        {
            "Gender": "Female",
            "Id": "Isabelle",
            "LanguageCode": "fr-BE",
            "LanguageName": "Belgian French",
            "Name": "Isabelle",
            "SupportedEngines": [
                "neural"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Gender": "Female",
            "Id": "Danielle",
            "LanguageCode": "en-US",
            "LanguageName": "US English",
            "Name": "Danielle",
            "SupportedEngines": [
                "generative",
                "long-form",
                "neural"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

From the voices output, you can select a voice that you want to perform the text to speech generation using the [`synthesize-speech`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/polly/synthesize-speech.html) command:

```sh
aws polly synthesize-speech --engine generative --voice-id Stephen --text "Hello from Polly this is Stephen speaking, using the Generative voice engine" --output-format mp3 polly_intro.mp3
```

Here we are selecting the `generative` engine (the most advanced Polly engine), using `Stephen` as our voice and saving the output as an `mp3` file named `polly_intro.mp3`. 

There may be times when the goal is to pass the contents of a file as a string into Polly via the command line for an ad-hoc synthesis. The follow steps can be followed to achieve the goal:

1. Create the sample text file to be used in the `synthesize-speech` command

    ```sh
    echo "Hello from Amazon Polly, you are using the AWS CLI to convert the contents of a text file into speech" > test_text.txt
    ```

1. Feed the file into the command

    ```sh
    aws polly synthesize-speech --engine generative --voice-id Stephen --text file://test_text.txt --output-format mp3 polly_file_input.mp3
    ```

The polly cli command can leverage `file` protocol to interact with files on the command line. Remember that Polly has a **3000 character** limit when using `synthesize-speech`

### Advanced Polly Commands

For larger synthesis need (over the 3000 character limit), a batch process can leverage the [`start_speech_synthesis_task`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/polly/start-speech-synthesis-task.html) command. This gives users the ability to process up-to 100,000 characters in a single execution. 

**NOTE** this is NOT meant for real-time usage.

1. Create and S3 bucket to store the output files using the s3api command
    ```sh
    aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <your-unique-name>
    ```

1. Create a sample test file to send to Polly
    ```sh
    echo "Hello from Amazon Polly, you are using the AWS CLI to convert the contents of a text file into speech using the batch processing of Polly" > polly_task_test.txt
    ```
1. Start the synthesis task using the

    ```sh
    aws polly start-speech-synthesis-task \
    --engine generative --output-format mp3 \
    --text file://polly_task_test.txt \
    --voice-id Joanna \
    --output-s3-bucket-name <your-unique-name>
    ```
    This will provide output that looks like:

    ```json
    {
        "SynthesisTask": {
            "Engine": "generative",
            "TaskId": "7ea22b1f-9906-47c1-8a8f-8667f9497230",
            "TaskStatus": "scheduled",
            "OutputUri": "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<your-unique-name>/7ea22b1f-9906-47c1-8a8f-8667f9497230.mp3",
            "CreationTime": "2025-04-25T10:14:53.905000-05:00",
            "RequestCharacters": 137,
            "OutputFormat": "mp3",
            "TextType": "text",
            "VoiceId": "Joanna"
        }
    }
    ```
    From the output capture the `TaskId` as it will be needed in the next few commands

1. Check the status of the processing task using [`get-speech-synthesis-task`](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/polly/get-speech-synthesis-task.html). The `TaskId` from the previous step will be needed here to retrieve the status, and will be different for every Task.
    ```sh
    aws polly get-speech-synthesis-task \
    --task-id 7ea22b1f-9906-47c1-8a8f-8667f9497230
    ```
    The output of the command shows the status of the Task, and will show `completed` once the audio file has been created and written to the s3 bucket
    ```json
        {
            "SynthesisTask": {
                "Engine": "generative",
                "TaskId": "7ea22b1f-9906-47c1-8a8f-8667f9497230",
                "TaskStatus": "completed",
                "OutputUri": "https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mishsc-polly-output/7ea22b1f-9906-47c1-8a8f-8667f9497230.mp3",
                "CreationTime": "2025-04-25T10:14:53.905000-05:00",
                "RequestCharacters": 137,
                "OutputFormat": "mp3",
                "TextType": "text",
                "VoiceId": "Joanna"
            }
        }
    ```
    Capture the `OutputUri` to created audio file.
1. Downloading the file using the `OutputUri` requires that the AWS credentials being used have access to the bucket. Once the IAM policies are in place, the `s3` `cp` command can be used to download the file. Here will replace the `https` protocol with `s3` using only bucket name and the file name
    ```sh
    aws s3 cp s3://mishsc-polly-output/7ea22b1f-9906-47c1-8a8f-8667f9497230.mp3 ./output.mp3
    ```
1. The `output.mp3` file should be downloaded locally and ready to play.

# Quick Start - Python

### Setup
```bash
# Install required packages
pip install boto3 ipython

# For Jupyter notebook support
pip install jupyter
```

Make sure you've configured your AWS credentials either through:
- AWS CLI (`aws configure`)
- Environment variables
- Credentials file (`~/.aws/credentials`)

### Your First Polly Script
```python
import boto3
from io import BytesIO
import pygame

# Create Amazon Polly client
polly = boto3.client('polly')

# Request speech synthesis
response = polly.synthesize_speech(
    Text="Hello, welcome to Amazon Polly!",
    OutputFormat="mp3",
    VoiceId="Joanna",
    Engine="neural"
)

# Play the audio using pygame
if "AudioStream" in response:
    pygame.mixer.init()
    pygame.init()
    
    with BytesIO(response["AudioStream"].read()) as audio_file:
        pygame.mixer.music.load(audio_file)
        pygame.mixer.music.play()
        
        while pygame.mixer.music.get_busy():
            pygame.time.Clock().tick(10)
```

This simple example:
1. Creates a connection to the Amazon Polly service
2. Sends a short text to be converted to speech using Joanna's neural voice
3. Receives the audio stream in the response
4. Plays the audio using the pygame library

Try changing the text or using different voices and engines to hear the differences!

    <!-- Emphasize words -->
    This is <emphasis level="strong">really</emphasis> important.
    
    <!-- Control speech rate -->
    <prosody rate="slow">This text is spoken slowly.</prosody>
    <prosody rate="fast">This text is spoken quickly.</prosody>
    
    <!-- Control pitch -->
    <prosody pitch="high">This text is spoken in a higher pitch.</prosody>
    <prosody pitch="low">This text is spoken in a lower pitch.</prosody>
    
    <!-- Specify how to pronounce words -->
    You say tomato, I say <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="tÉËmeÉªtoÊ">tomato</phoneme>.
    
    <!-- Specify how to read certain types of text -->

# Practical Examples

### Sample Code Snippets

#### Asynchronous Synthesis with S3 (Python)
```python
import boto3
import time

# Create clients
polly = boto3.client('polly')
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# Start a speech synthesis task
response = polly.start_speech_synthesis_task(
    Text="This is a long piece of text that exceeds the limits of the synchronous API...",
    OutputFormat="mp3",
    OutputS3BucketName="your-bucket-name",
    OutputS3KeyPrefix="speech/",
    VoiceId="Matthew",
    Engine="neural"
)

# Get the task ID
task_id = response['SynthesisTask']['TaskId']
print(f"Task ID: {task_id}")

# Wait for the task to complete
while True:
    task = polly.get_speech_synthesis_task(TaskId=task_id)
    status = task['SynthesisTask']['TaskStatus']
    
    if status == 'completed':
        output_uri = task['SynthesisTask']['OutputUri']
        print(f"Task completed! Audio available at: {output_uri}")
        break
    elif status == 'failed':
        print("Task failed!")
        break
    else:
        print(f"Task status: {status}")
        time.sleep(2)
```

#### Using SSML (Python)
```python
import boto3

# Create Amazon Polly client
polly = boto3.client('polly')

# SSML text
ssml_text = """
<speak>
    Hello! <break time="1s"/> Welcome to <emphasis level="strong">Amazon Polly</emphasis>.
    You can use SSML to add <prosody rate="slow">dramatic pauses</prosody>,
    control <prosody pitch="high">the pitch of the voice</prosody>,
    and even spell out <say-as interpret-as="characters">SSML</say-as>.
</speak>
"""

# Request speech synthesis with SSML
response = polly.synthesize_speech(
    Text=ssml_text,
    TextType="ssml",
    OutputFormat="mp3",
    VoiceId="Joanna",
    Engine="neural"
)

# Save the audio to a file
if "AudioStream" in response:
    with open("output.mp3", "wb") as file:
        file.write(response["AudioStream"].read())
    print("Audio saved to output.mp3")
```

### Common Use Case Solutions

#### Multilingual Content
```python
# Example for handling multilingual content
ssml_text = """
<speak>
    Here is some English text.
    <lang xml:lang="es-ES">Y aquÃ­ hay texto en espaÃ±ol.</lang>
    <lang xml:lang="fr-FR">Et voici du texte en franÃ§ais.</lang>
</speak>
"""

response = polly.synthesize_speech(
    Text=ssml_text,
    TextType="ssml",
    OutputFormat="mp3",
    VoiceId="Joanna",  # Must be a voice that supports language mixing
    Engine="neural"
)
```

#### Dynamic Voice Selection
```python
def get_appropriate_voice(language_code, gender_preference=None):
    """Select appropriate voice based on language and gender preference"""
    response = polly.describe_voices(LanguageCode=language_code)
    voices = response['Voices']
    
    # Filter by gender if preference is specified
    if gender_preference:
        voices = [v for v in voices if v['Gender'].lower() == gender_preference.lower()]
    
    # Prioritize neural voices
    neural_voices = [v for v in voices if v['SupportedEngines'] and 'neural' in v['SupportedEngines']]
    
    if neural_voices:
        return neural_voices[0]['Id']
    elif voices:
        return voices[0]['Id']
    else:
        raise Exception(f"No voice found for language {language_code} and gender {gender_preference}")
```

#### Pronunciation Lexicon Implementation
```python
# Example lexicon in PLS format
lexicon_content = """
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<lexicon version="1.0" 
      xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/01/pronunciation-lexicon"

"""

# Store the lexicon
polly.put_lexicon(
    Name="tech-terms",
    Content=lexicon_content
)

# Use the lexicon in synthesis
response = polly.synthesize_speech(
    Text="AWS provides SQL database services.",
    OutputFormat="mp3",
    VoiceId="Matthew",
    LexiconNames=["tech-terms"]
)
```
